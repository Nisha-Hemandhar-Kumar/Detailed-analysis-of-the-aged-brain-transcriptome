### Summary to perform Differential transcript usage analysis
To delve deeper into isoform resolution, with a focus on isoform switching and its potential consequences associated with alternative splicing, we performed DTU (Differential Transcript Usage) analysis using the IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR v1.12.0 (78) package. In this analysis, we applied several filtering steps to ensure robust results. Initially, we filtered transcript counts based on geneExpressionCutoff ≤ 5 and isoformExpressionCutoff ≤ 3, and only considering genes with at least two isoforms by setting removeSingleIsoformGenes = TRUE. The isoform switches, indicating differences in alternative splicing events, were then identified using the isoformSwitchAnalysisPart1() function, employing the DEXSeq switchTestMethod. Additionally, to perform sequence analysis, we set the parameter outputSequences to TRUE, allowing us to obtain nucleotide and amino acid sequences for further analysis. We utilized these sequences to predict protein domains using pfam and coding potential using CPC2. For analyzing alternative splicing events, we used the object obtained from isoformSwitchAnalysisPart1() as input for the analyzeAlternativeSplicing() function. The summary of the identified isoform switches was extracted using extractSplicingSummary() and then tested for enrichment and significance in the aged brain using extractSplicingEnrichment() with default parameters. We further calculated the isoform usage for each alternative splicing type using extractSplicingGenomeWide(). To predict the functional consequences of the isoform switches, we employed the isoformSwitchAnalysisPart2() function, considering inputs from CPC2 and PFAM results. We evaluated several consequences, including 'intron_retention', 'coding_potential', 'ORF_seq_similarity', 'NMD_status', and 'domains_identified'. The consequence summary and enrichment were generated using the extractConsequenceSummary() and extractConsequenceEnrichment() functions. The significance test was performed using R's exact binomial test “binom.test()” with default parameters and the resulting p-values are adjusted with “p.adjust()” using FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg). By performing this comprehensive isoform-level analysis, we gain valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of alternative splicing and isoform switching in the context of brain aging, providing a deeper understanding of the potential functional implications of these molecular events.
